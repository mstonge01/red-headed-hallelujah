1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,760
I check thethermostat,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,040
read the outsideair.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,099
It says don't go out there without a properpair.

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,099
I'm zipping up myjacket,

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,080
putting gloves on myhand.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,660
Preparing for the freeze that grips this northernland.

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,460
But I hear the click-clack coming down thehall.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,719
Like she's stepping off the sand right past the gardenwall.

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,980
Ooh.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,039
I don't even askher,

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,239
I alreadyknow.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,280
She's got a secret summer in the middle of thesnow.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,840
Shesays,

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,820
"I need myfreedom,

15
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,588
need to feel thefloor."

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,799
Then she grabs her heavy coat and heads right for thedoor.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,920
She's walking on the zero-degreebeach.

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,659
The comfort of thatplastic,

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,899
nothing else canreach.

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,479
She's walking on the zero-degreebeach.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,009
A beautiful stubborn habit that the cold can'tteach.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,000
No matter if it's autumn or a Januarysleet.

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,569
She's got the only summer that exists beneath herfeet.

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:16,120
My quirky queen in her flip-flops all yearlong.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,920
We went to awedding,

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,950
the venue was sogrand.

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,920
White gloves and polished shoes across the marbleland.

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,079
She looked like a millionbucks,

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,780
every hair was inplace.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,019
Except for that telltale sign of her personalspace.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,400
When she kicked off her heels just an hour after thedance.

32
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,400
And swapped in the cheap sandals with an affectionateglance.

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:40,879
Said,

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,640
"These are the trueme,

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,180
this is how Ithrive.

36
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,670
The only person keeping Californiaalive."

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,180
Other peoplestare,

38
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,959
they give a littlelook.

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,489
But they don't know the comfort that she's found inside thathook.

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,280
They don't know thestory,

41
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,540
thededication,

42
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,530
thepieces.

43
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,879
Got her priorities and they're never gonnasee.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,599
She's walking on the zero-degreebeach.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,379
The comfort of thatplastic,

46
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,580
nothing else canreach.

47
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,180
She's walking on the zero-degreebeach.

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,699
A beautiful stubborn habit that the cold can'tteach.

49
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,680
No matter if it's autumn or a Januarysleet.

50
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,219
She's got the only summer that exists beneath herfeet.

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,300
My quirky queen in her flip-flops all yearlong.

52
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,400
It's just a little thing Iknow,

53
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,439
an insignificanttrait.

54
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,650
But it's one of those small wonders that Icelebrate.

55
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,319
You found the perfect lifehack,

56
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,099
the ultimaterelease.

57
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,340
You choose your ownweather,

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,000
you choose your ownpeace.

59
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,300
All yearlong.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Ooh.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,340
A zero-degreebeach.

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,719
Ooh.

63
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah,

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,620
all yearlong.

65
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:19,659
Ooh.
