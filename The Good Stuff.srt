1
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,059
My best friend had an artclass,

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,980
I think it was101.

3
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,940
They talked aboutPicasso,

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,899
and what to do forfun.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,179
He sat beside a girl heknew,

6
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,118
they chatted 'bout theweek.

7
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,990
And somehow they got on the topic of a bit ofmystique.

8
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:47,740
She said she'd always wondered but never took thechance.

9
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,100
My buddysaid,

10
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,520
"I know aguy,

11
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,600
let'scircumstance."

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,979
He calls me up on my flipphone,

13
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:57,380
says,

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:57,679
"Man,

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,200
I need afavor.

16
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,040
My friend wants theexperience,

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,269
can you supply theflavor?"

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:08,769
Hesaid,

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,480
"You know the goodstuff,

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,540
you got the masterplan."

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:15,640
Isaid,

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:15,840
"Yeah,

23
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,340
I'm yourguy.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,209
I'll do what Ican."

25
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,200
Just anotherTuesday,

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,180
a simple youthfulquest.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,120
I had no idea it was a cosmictest.

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,420
We met up on aSaturday,

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,260
as I rememberwell.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,120
And that's the day I saw your face and stumbled where Ifell.

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,540
You had that long redhair,

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,060
and freckles and a choker on yourneck.

33
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,689
My brain just wentoffline,

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,480
I was a totalwreck.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,920
The mission was afailure,

36
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,260
a total epicbust.

37
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,760
But I didn't evennotice,

38
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,199
I found my sacredtrust.

39
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,900
Who needs the good stuff when I'm looking atyou?

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,819
My whole world changed thatafternoon.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,120
We stood there kindaawkward,

42
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,340
kicking gravel with ourshoes.

43
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,960
I was trying to becharming,

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,120
probably breaking all therules.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,179
You talked about your paintings and the bands you loved themost.

46
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,680
I just kept onnodding,

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,120
acting like your humblehost.

48
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,319
My contact wasn'tanswering,

49
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,120
my other guy wasdry.

50
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,400
Our little rebel outing was a kissgoodbye.

51
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,800
My friend was soembarrassed,

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:03,810
said,

53
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,259
"Sorry,

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,169
this islame."

55
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,620
I just stood theresmiling,

56
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,379
trying to remember my ownname.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,740
Hesaid,

58
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:08,979
"Man,

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,289
this is adisaster,"

60
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,819
as he hung up thephone.

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,419
Isaid,

62
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,500
"I don't knowman,

63
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,430
I'm feeling kinda blownaway."

64
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,780
We met up on aSaturday,

65
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,479
as I rememberwell.

66
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:28,879
And that's the day I saw your face and stumbled where Ifell.

67
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,039
You had that long redhair,

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,340
and freckles and a choker on yourneck.

69
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,960
My brain just wentoffline,

70
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,539
I was a totalwreck.

71
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,199
The mission was afailure,

72
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:47,340
a total epicbust.

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,039
But I didn't evennotice,

74
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,879
I found my sacredtrust.

75
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:59,919
Who needs the good stuff when I'm looking atyou?

76
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,979
My whole world changed thatafternoon.

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,259
It's funny how a stupidplan,

78
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:18,800
a half-baked high school plot could be the single greatest stroke of luck I evergot.

79
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
We were just kids trying to find a littlebuzz,

80
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,540
but I found my forever rightthere.

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,699
Just because I saw thefuture,

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,540
I saw the white hairs and the wrinkledhands.

83
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,959
I saw the family we would build on these suburbanlands.

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,360
We met up on aSaturday,

85
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,120
as I rememberwell.

86
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,420
And that's the day I saw your face and stumbled where Ifell.

87
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,620
You had that long redhair,

88
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,259
and freckles and a choker on yourneck.

89
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,959
My brain just wentoffline,

90
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,699
I was a totalwreck.

91
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,779
The mission was afailure,

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,540
a total epicbust.

93
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,620
But I didn't evennotice,

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,639
I found my sacredtrust.

95
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,759
Who needs the good stuff when I'm looking atyou?

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
My whole world changed thatafternoon.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,399
Yeah,

98
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,120
we never gothigh,

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,420
not in the way wemeant.

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,759
But you're the best thing that was everheaven-sent.

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,920
The plan went up in smoke before it evenlit.

102
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,180
But finding you was the ultimatehit.

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,410
Yeah,

104
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,759
you're the goodstuff.

105
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,759
You alwayswere.
