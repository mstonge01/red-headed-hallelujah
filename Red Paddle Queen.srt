1
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,160
Yeah.

2
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:14,720
Sun'shigh,

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,519
waterclear.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,559
Reflections on theglass.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,690
I'm chillin' on the shore lettin' summer dayspass.

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:21,649
Then the sceneshifts,

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,019
the vibe lifts as you come intoview.

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,440
A vision on thewater,

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,769
everything brandnew.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,589
This ain't no mud boatridin',

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,500
no four-wheel drivesound.

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,500
Just a simple board beneath you glidin' without asound.

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,060
But there's grace in yourmotion,

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,439
the way you ride thebreeze.

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,359
Got me pausin' myworld,

16
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,780
sinkin' to myknees.

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,200
Paved roadsdisappear,

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,799
street lights out ofsight.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,768
Just the shimmer of the lake bathed in goldenlight.

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,479
I've seen the glitz andglamour,

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,899
heard the big citybeat.

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,670
But the silent elegance youhold,

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:50,899
man,

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,088
it just can't bebeat.

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,429
Oh,

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,409
the red paddle queen settin' fire to thetide.

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,570
That scarlet wave of hair where the sunlight loves tohide.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,979
You glide where the currentsflow,

29
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,500
you're on a liquidstream.

30
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,539
With everystroke,

31
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:03,299
everymove,

32
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,930
you can't bebeat.

33
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,459
On the board in thebreeze,

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,019
you're the only sight Ineed.

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,420
The red paddlequeen,

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,980
a natural beautyindeed.

37
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:14,340
From a distance I could tell you're a man of yourspace.

38
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,719
Got that countryfocus,

39
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,299
that clear look on yourface.

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,579
Then you turn toward the banks and your smile hits the air like an instant dose ofsunshine,

41
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,780
showin' you don't care about thegossip,

42
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,609
thenoise,

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,180
the usualdistractions.

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,540
You're plugged into themoment,

45
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,180
pure physics andreactions.

46
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,500
I admire thebalance,

47
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,319

48
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,299
the silentpower.

49
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,439
Like you're walkin' on the surface in your own specifichour.

50
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,019
The paved roadsdisappear,

51
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,620
the street lights out ofsight.

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,590
Just the shimmer of the lake bathed in goldenlight.

53
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,319
I've seen the glitz andglamour,

54
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,719

55
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,500
But the silent elegance youhold,

56
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:47,730
man,

57
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:48,930
it just can't bebeat.

58
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:49,260
Oh,

59
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,239
the red paddle queen settin' fire to thetide.

60
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,379
That scarlet wave of hair where the sunlight loves tohide.

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,799
You glide where the currentsflow,

62
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,359
you're on a liquidstream.

63
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,379
With everystroke,

64
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,140

the perfect hue on a canvas ofblue.

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,639
You make the simple act look like somethin' brandnew.

77
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,419
It's more than just apaddle,

78
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,849
more than just aride.

79
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,960
It's the confidence you carry with nothin' left tohide.

80
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,340
Gotta watch that hair flip one moretime,

81
