00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:03,138
Wait.

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,418
Thewaves,

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,019
theyroared,

5
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,238
the night wasblack,

6
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,659
a lantern swung on the captain'srack.

7
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:15,259
But there she swam with hair of flame and called me out by my ownname.

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:16,460
Oh,

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,600
the crimsontide,

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,719
it pulled menear.

11
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:19,978
Her voice likegold,

12
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,399
her smile soclear.

13
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:27,600
A red-haired mermaid stole my heart and dragged me down to where dreamsstart.

14
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey.

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,158
Her eyes were green like kelp atdawn,

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,560
her laughter rang like a siren'ssong.

17
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:36,719
I reached myhand,

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,380
she held it tight and pulled me deep into thenight.

19
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:48,039
What's a man to do at sea when a mermaid sets his spiritfree?

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,259
Oh,

21
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,418

30
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:10,959
