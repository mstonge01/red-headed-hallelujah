00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:28,079
The little green light on the CD player is the only thing I'm focused on besidesher.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,859

She spins around and her red hairflies.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,700
A perfect blurry mess before myeyes.

33
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,079
She's got thismove,

34
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,319

She's jumping on the beat then stops on adime.

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,700
She's in her ownworld,

40
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,659
and she's outside oftime.

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,480

The song breaksdown,

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,599

57
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,400
