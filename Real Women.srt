00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,339

00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,679
Pink manicures and little whitelies,

they spend their whole damn paycheck on what moneybuys.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,920
Little bows and kittenheels,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,359
scared to break asweat.

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:47,759

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,299
They're filterin' pictures till their skin ispristine.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,299
Afraid of asmudge,

33
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,420
afraid of what's real andmean.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,140
Obsessed with the weight on that digitalscale,
