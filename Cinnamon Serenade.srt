1
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,339
The cabin lights were settledin.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,539
The family fastasleep.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,800
The fireplace wasembers.

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,620
A promise I couldn'tkeep.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,039
Isaid,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,690
"Goodnight,

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,359
my darling" and hit the flannelsheets.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,649
You stayed out by the fireglow.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,100
Sipping somethingsweet.

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,859
A bottle full ofcinnamon,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,740
they call itFireball.

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,539
You said it's just soeasy.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,479
Leaning on thewall.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,340
You didn't see thedanger.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,000
The sugarydisguise.

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,759
Just the dancing flames reflected in youreyes.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:52,960
Oh,

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:53,509
but3:00

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,520
AM came calling with a crash and then amoan.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,060
You woke me from my slumber clutching the plasticthrone.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,990
And I was your humble servant in the palemoonlight.

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,500
Holding back your lovely head with all mymight.

23
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,319
It wasn't wine androses.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,840
It wasn'tgraceful,

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,299
no.

26
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:18,519
But you're my cinnamonqueen.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,659
Even watching the bourbonflow.

28
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,980
Ha!

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,780
That devil in abottle.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,000
It whispers candylies.

31
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,920
A liquid Trojanhorse.

32
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,359
A burning sweetsurprise.

33
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,129
Shot after shot wentdown.

34
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,959
Smooth as a velvetglove.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,659
You lost all track of reason and lost all track oflove.

36
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,079
Orsobriety.

37
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,810
The silence of theforest.

38
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,500
Shattered by thesound.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,319
Shattered by thesound.

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,819
Shattered by thesound.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,099
Of all that cinnamonwhiskey.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,620
Fighting the wrong wayround.

43
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:11,740
Oh,

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,250
but3:00

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,259
AM came calling with a crash and then amoan.

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,810
You woke me from my slumber clutching the plasticthrone.

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,740
And I was your humble servant in the palemoonlight.

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,340
Holding back your lovely head with all mymight.

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,300
It wasn't wine androses.

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,580
It wasn'tgraceful,

51
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,520
no.

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,699
But you're my cinnamonqueen.

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,400
Even watching the bourbonflow.

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,479
Now some guys get asiren.

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,639
A goddess on apedestal.

56
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,500
Mine was kneelingover.

57
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,219
Looking ratherdreadful.

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,780
But as I held your forehead andwhispered,

59
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,009
"It's allright."

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,780
My love was shining clearer than the stars on that coldnight.

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,180
It's not the perfectmoments.

62
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:12,879
It's the ones we survive that prove you're still the only one who makes me feelalive.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,659
Ohyeah,

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,090
3:00

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,020
AM came calling with a crash and then amoan.

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
You woke me from my slumber clutching the plasticthrone.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,319
And I was your humble servant in the palemoonlight.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,099
Holding back your lovely head with all mymight.

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,800
It wasn't wine androses.

70
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,360
It wasn'tgraceful,

71
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,060
no.

72
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,020
But you're my cinnamonqueen.

73
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,460
Even watching the bourbonflow.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,639
Yeah.

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
My cinnamonqueen.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,139
A crown of messyhair.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,379
Worship in the trashcan.

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:26,000
But I'll always be rightthere.
